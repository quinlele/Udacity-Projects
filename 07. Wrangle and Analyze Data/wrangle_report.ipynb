    "# Wrangle Report\n",
    " \n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset that I was wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog\n",
    "\n",
    "This report briefly describes my work. The steps of wrangling this dataset are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Gathering data\n",
    "\n",
    "• Assessing data\n",
    "\n",
    "• Cleaning data\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Gathering data\n",
    "\n",
    "My gathering data work gathered data from these sources\n",
    "\n",
    "• Directly download the WeRateDogs Twitter archive data (twitter_archive_enhanced.csv), naming the dataset \"twi_arch_enhanced\"\n",
    "\n",
    "• Use the Requests library to download the tweet image prediction (image_predictions.tsv), naming the dataset \"img_pred\"\n",
    "\n",
    "• Use the Tweepy library to query additional data via the Twitter API (tweet_json.txt), naming the dataset \"twe_json\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Assessing data\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the 3 data sources were gathered I assessed the data on both quality and tidiness issues as following:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quality issue\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In twi_arch_enhanced, remove of Retweets\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In twi_arch_enhanced, some useless column\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In twi_arch_enhanced, Dog names not corrected, there are some value like ['such', 'a', 'quite', 'not', 'one', 'an', 'very', 'just', 'actually', 'getting', 'this', 'unacceptable', 'all', 'old', 'infuriating', 'the', 'by', 'officially']\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In twe_json, some useless column\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In twi_arch_enhanced, the timestamp column must be datetime not string\n",
    "\n",
    "6. In twi_arch_enhanced, keep only date for 'timestamp' column\n",
    "\n",
    "7. In img_pred, some duplicate at 'jpg_url' column\n",
    "\n",
    "8. In img_pred, 'p1,p2,p3' columns: dog breeds are not consistently lower or uppercase\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tidiness issue\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Doggo, floofer, pupper, puppo columns are untidy beacause it's all about breed dog but have 4 columns\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Merge 3 datasets into one using inner join according to the tweet_id\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Cleaning data\n",
    "\n",
    "• Remove is not null value in retweeted_status_id\n",
    "\n",
    "• Drop columns that won't use for the analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "• Remove value that are not name of dogs\n",
    "\n",
    "• Change datatype from string to datetime for 'timestamp' column in twi_arch_enhanced and keep only date for the column\n",
    "\n",
    "• Change datatype from integer to string for 'tweet_id' column in twi_arch_enhanced\n",
    "\n",
    "• Drop duplicate for 'jpg_url' column\n",
    "\n",
    "• Change value in p1, p2, p3 column into lowercase\n",
    "\n",
    "• Merge doggo, floofer, pupper, puppo columns\n",
    "\n",
    "• Merge 3 datasets into one using inner join according to the tweet_id"
